# Sketch-Zeplin Workflow

- TO avoid slight color variations when using the color picker in Sketch, be sure to pick the color at the center of an element.
- Be sure there are no rogue text fields in your design as this tends to show up in Zeplin
- In Zeplin, name all colors used in the design
- Avoid using phone templates. Stick to artboards. The output is easier to use in prototyping apps such as Invision.
- Use proper numbering and naming for Artboards just as you would for Photoshop layers
- In Sketch, make all icons and images exportable so that it will be easier to export assets in Zeplin.


# Frontend Coding Workflow

- Make it a habit to use a different default browser everyday. Do not stick to one browser.
- Always check your work using your browser's responsive design mode.
- Always check your work using your mobile phone.
- Safari is the new IE. Use Safari more often.
